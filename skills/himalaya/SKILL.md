# Himalaya Email CLI

Himalaya is a CLI email client that lets you manage emails from the terminal using IMAP, SMTP, Notmuch, or Sendmail backends.

## References

- `references/configuration.md` (config file setup + IMAP/SMTP authentication)
- `references/message-composition.md` (MML syntax for composing emails)

## Prerequisites

1. Himalaya CLI installed (`himalaya --version` to verify)
2. A configuration file at `~/.config/himalaya/config.toml`
3. IMAP/SMTP credentials configured (password stored securely)

## Automation Rule

- For local macOS/email checks, prefer read-only commands first:
  `himalaya account list`, `himalaya folder list`, `himalaya envelope list`.
- If configuration is missing, do not dump raw CLI noise back to the user.
  Explain that email is not connected yet and offer to help set it up.
- Treat send/reply/forward as higher-risk actions; prove read-only access first.

## Configuration Setup

Do not tell a consumer user to go run terminal commands on their own unless they
explicitly asked for the CLI path. The agent should own the setup flow:

1. Detect that Himalaya is not configured.
2. Tell the user email is not connected yet.
3. Offer to set it up with them.
4. Ask only for the information or approvals the user must provide.
5. If browser or GUI automation is available, prefer guiding or driving the
   provider login flow there instead of sending the user to a terminal.

The raw CLI wizard is still useful when you are the one executing the setup:

```bash
himalaya account configure
```

If the user asks to check email and setup is missing, respond like a product
assistant, not like a README. Good pattern:

- "Email is not connected yet."
- "I can help set it up now."
- "I’ll need your email provider plus permission to walk through login/config."
- "Once connected, I can read your inbox from here."

Or create `~/.config/himalaya/config.toml` manually:

```toml
[accounts.personal]
email = "you@example.com"
display-name = "Your Name"
default = true

backend.type = "imap"
backend.host = "imap.example.com"
backend.port = 993
backend.encryption.type = "tls"
backend.login = "you@example.com"
backend.auth.type = "password"
backend.auth.cmd = "pass show email/imap"  # or use keyring

message.send.backend.type = "smtp"
message.send.backend.host = "smtp.example.com"
message.send.backend.port = 587
message.send.backend.encryption.type = "start-tls"
message.send.backend.login = "you@example.com"
message.send.backend.auth.type = "password"
message.send.backend.auth.cmd = "pass show email/smtp"
```

## Common Operations

### List Folders

```bash
himalaya folder list
```

If `himalaya` says it cannot find configuration, treat that as a setup-needed
state, not as a hard product failure. Do not echo the raw "Cannot find
configuration" error back to the user unless they explicitly asked for the CLI
details.

### List Emails

List emails in INBOX (default):

```bash
himalaya envelope list
```

List emails in a specific folder:

```bash
himalaya envelope list --folder "Sent"
```

List with pagination:

```bash
himalaya envelope list --page 1 --page-size 20
```

### Search Emails

```bash
himalaya envelope list from john@example.com subject meeting
```

### Read an Email

Read email by ID (shows plain text):

```bash
himalaya message read 42
```

Export raw MIME:

```bash
himalaya message export 42 --full
```

### Reply to an Email

Interactive reply (opens $EDITOR):

```bash
himalaya message reply 42
```

Reply-all:

```bash
himalaya message reply 42 --all
```

### Forward an Email

```bash
himalaya message forward 42
```

### Write a New Email

Interactive compose (opens $EDITOR):

```bash
himalaya message write
```

Send directly using template:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | himalaya template send
From: you@example.com
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: Test Message

Hello from Himalaya!
EOF
```

Or with headers flag:

```bash
himalaya message write -H "To:recipient@example.com" -H "Subject:Test" "Message body here"
```

### Move/Copy Emails

Move to folder:

```bash
himalaya message move 42 "Archive"
```

Copy to folder:

```bash
himalaya message copy 42 "Important"
```

### Delete an Email

```bash
himalaya message delete 42
```

### Manage Flags

Add flag:

```bash
himalaya flag add 42 --flag seen
```

Remove flag:

```bash
himalaya flag remove 42 --flag seen
```

## Multiple Accounts

List accounts:

```bash
himalaya account list
```

Use a specific account:

```bash
himalaya --account work envelope list
```

## Attachments

Save attachments from a message:

```bash
himalaya attachment download 42
```

Save to specific directory:

```bash
himalaya attachment download 42 --dir ~/Downloads
```

## Output Formats

Most commands support `--output` for structured output:

```bash
himalaya envelope list --output json
himalaya envelope list --output plain
```

## Debugging

Enable debug logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug himalaya envelope list
```

Full trace with backtrace:

```bash
RUST_LOG=trace RUST_BACKTRACE=1 himalaya envelope list
```

## Tips

- Use `himalaya --help` or `himalaya <command> --help` for detailed usage.
- Message IDs are relative to the current folder; re-list after folder changes.
- For composing rich emails with attachments, use MML syntax (see `references/message-composition.md`).
- Store passwords securely using `pass`, system keyring, or a command that outputs the password.
